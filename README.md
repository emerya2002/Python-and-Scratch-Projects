# Python-and-Scratch-Projects

Python Project:
- This random password generator was created with Python 3.10.11. By utilizing user inputs, this program offers a simple, and clean way to generate random passwords, specific to what a user is looking for in their password. I also used simple flow control components (such as if and else statements) to request information from the user, such as if they would like to include digits and/or symbols and/or letters within their password. I also imported random, string, and array modules. 

Scratch Project:
- This pong game simulates a game where the ball hits the paddle, then rotates 180 degrees, and proceeds to move towards an edge. Once it hits an edge, it bounces off, and the game continues until the the user stops playing, or the ball hits the red line. If the ball hits the red line, the background changes and the game is over. Also, the ball speeds up when the score hits a different interval of 5, until it reaches 15, where the speed remains the same. Therefore there are 3 levels.
